        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>28 ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 Tbsp molasses</li>
        <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Allspice</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Chilli powder</li>
        <li>Ground ginger</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 spring parsley</li>
        <li>2 slices white bread</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by finely dicing one small onion and 5 cloves of garlic.</li>
        <li>Add onion to a pot with 1 Tbsp of olive oil and cook over a medium high heat and for 5-6 minutes before adding your garlic and cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add one 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes along with ¼ cup of brown sugar, 1-2 Tbsp of molasses, ⅓ cup of apple cider vinegar, and 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. We are also going to add some sprinklings of allspice, cinnamon, chili powder, and ground ginger.</li>
        <li>Stir and then let sit for 1-12 hours. The longer it sits, the better the flavors will be.</li>
        <li>Once it has sat, add to a blender and blend at first on low and then on high until fully incorporated. </li>
        <li>Add to a squeeze bottle for easy use. </li>
        <li>Next, in a small nonstick pan, add 1 Tbsp of butter over a medium high heat. Once melted, add 1 egg.</li>
        <li>Move the egg around quickly to make an egg custard of sorts and once it holds its own shape, flatten it out into a single layer. </li>
        <li>Add some grated cheddar cheese on top of the egg.</li>
        <li>Use the spatula to fold the egg over, top with some fresh pepper and then place the egg on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cover the egg with homemade ketchup and then make a sandwich using 2 slices of white bread and a sprig of parsley. Add bacon to take the sandwich to take it to the next level.</li>
    </ol>
